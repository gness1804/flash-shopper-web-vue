# Flash Shopper Web

> A Vue.js project

[Check it out!](https://gness1804.github.io/flash-shopper-web-vue/#/)

Version: 1.1.0

This is the web version of my [Flash Shopper React Native app](https://github.com/gness1804/flash-shopper-mobile). It is a simple grocery list app built on Firebase that contains a main list and a pantry list (for frequently purchased item).

More details coming soon.

## Build Setup (from the Vue.js docs):

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
